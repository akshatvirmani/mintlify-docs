## Introduction

APIs are a big part of web development today, helping apps get real-time data from different sources. [GitHub's REST API](https://api.github.com/) is one of the useful ones, letting you access details about user profiles, repositories, and programming languages in projects.


To make it easier to work with this data in React apps, we've created a custom hook called ```useGitHub```. The ```useGitHub``` hook makes connecting to the GitHub API simple and takes care of the data you get from it. It fetches user info and repositories, handles errors, and lets you filter repositories by programming language. 

Using React-based tools for managing state and updates, the hook keeps the data current and easy to use, making it a practical tool for developers looking to add GitHub data to their apps.
